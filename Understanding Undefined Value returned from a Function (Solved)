Challange: Understanding Undefined Value returned from a Function.
The return statement is included in a function but it is not really neccessary, in such cases there is no return
statement in the function and when you call the function it processes the inner statement and return "undefined as the value.
Example.

var sum;
function addThree(num) {
sum = sum + num;  
};
var returnevalue = addThree(3)
//Output
undefined.

addThree has no return statement function. The function will change the global sum variable but the returned 
value of the function is undefined

//TASK
In this lesson we are ask to create a function addFive without any arguments. This function adds 5 to the sum variable,
but its returned value is undefined.

// HINTS GIVEN
addFive should be a function
sum should be equal to 8
Returned value from addFive should be undefined
Inside of your functions, add 5 to the sum variable

// CODE EXPLAINED BELOW.
// sum declared and equal to 8
var sum = 8;
// addFive is a function with sum as parameter but no arguments
function addFive(sum) {
sum = sum + 5;
};
var returnedValue = addFive();
